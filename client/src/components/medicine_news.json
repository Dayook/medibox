Alexander K\u00f6pke/EyeEm/Getty ImagesGuidelines for obesity management tend to focus on weight loss through calorie restriction and increased physical activity.Weight loss is often difficult to sustain, and repeated weight loss attempts are associated with adverse health outcomes.A recent review shows that increased physical activity and improvements in fitness levels can reduce the risk of obesity-related health conditions and mortality, even in the absence of weight loss.An obesity management approach that primarily focuses on improving fitness rather than weight loss may be at least as effective as weight loss in reducing the adverse health consequences of obesity.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 42.4% of adults in the United States were obese in 2017\u20132018, a marked increase from 30.5% in 1999\u20132000.An increase in adults attempting to lose weight has mirrored this surge in obesity rates. However, the restriction in calorie intake that is necessary for weight loss can be difficult to sustain over a prolonged period.Moreover, many individuals are unable to achieve their target weight, while those who manage to often struggle to maintain it.Both of these situations can lead to frustration and reduced adherence to the weight loss program, eventually resulting in a cycle of gaining and losing weight. This fluctuation in weight is known as weight cycling, and it is associated with adverse health outcomes.The rapid rise in obesity rates despite the increased focus on reducing weight reflects the limits of this weight loss-centric approach to obesity management. Yet, guidelines for obesity management continue to advocate the practices of limiting calorie intake and increasing physical activity levels. Over the past 2 decades, some scientists have argued that an approach focused on weight loss may be misplaced when it comes to obesity management. Instead, they suggest that a \u201cfat-but-fit\u201d approach based on increasing physical activity levels and improving cardiorespiratory fitness should be the primary focus for those looking to lose excess body weight.Advocates of the fat-but-fit approach to obesity treatment argue that improving fitness, even in the absence of weight loss, can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.While physical activity refers to any movement that results in energy expenditure, cardiorespiratory fitness is a measure of overall physical fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness measures the ability of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to sustain physical activity over an extended period. Now, a recent review that features in the journal iScience looks at how to reduce the risk of obesity-related health conditions and mortality. It compares the effectiveness of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness with that of weight loss.The evidence that the review presents suggests that the fat-but-fit approach may be at least as effective as weight loss in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality due to obesity. Furthermore, this fitness-focused strategy avoids the pitfalls of the weight loss approach."}, {"title": "COVID-19 vaccines work in MS patients despite immunotherapy treatment", "url": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com//articles/covid-19-vaccines-work-in-ms-patients-despite-immunotherapy-treatment", "img": "//i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Covid-19_vaccine_GettyImages1235380609_header-1024x575.jpg?w=1155&h=1528", "contents": "New research suggests COVID-19 vaccines work in people with MS who are undergoing treatment. PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty ImagesMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease, typically treated by quelling the activity of immune system cells, such as B lymphocytes.COVID-19 vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to generate antibodies to the virus responsible for the disease.Anti-CD20 drugs help combat the progression of MS by limiting the activity of B cells. In 20 people taking anti-CD20 drugs for MS, there was still a robust T cell response to vaccination for COVID-19.MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system\u2019s ability to communicate efficiently. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), about one million people in the United States are living with the disease.Health experts consider MS to be an inflammatory disease. It affects the myelin sheath, a fatty insulating layer surrounding the nerve cells that helps them transmit electrical impulses rapidly. It is unclear why, but in people with MS, the B cells of their immune system attack the myelin sheath. This gradually erodes nerve impulse transmission. Individuals with this progressive disease experience debilitating symptoms such as numbness, tremor, fatigue, or blurred vision.Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.Many people with MS have experienced significant relief from the progression of their disease by using modern drugs called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Specifically, these drugs target B cells, limiting their ability to attack the myelin sheath to slow or even halt the progression of MS. Because they work by limiting the activity of the immune system, health experts consider people taking anti-CD20 drugs as immunocompromised."}, {"title": "Atherosclerosis present in 42% of adults without heart disease", "url": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com//articles/atherosclerosis-present-in-42-percent-of-adults-without-heart-disease", "img": "//i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Atherosclerosis_heart_GettyImages139823532_Header-1024x575.jpg?w=1155&h=1528", "contents": "The image shows atherosclerosis in the coronary artery. Ed Reschke/Getty ImagesA study conducted in Sweden found that about 42% of the participants without known heart disease or symptoms had fatty deposits in the arteries of their heart, which experts call atherosclerosis.Approximately 5% of the participants had significant obstruction of blood flow in one or more of the three coronary arteries, while 2% had severe disease.Older male participants of the study had a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis.Long-term follow-up data are necessary to establish the clinical relevance of these findings and to determine the best high risk screening strategies.The number of deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) in the United States decreased 9.8% in years 2008\u20132018. However, CHD remained the number one cause of death in the U.S. in 2018, leading to about 366,000 deaths. CHD occurs as a result of coronary artery disease (CAD).In atherosclerosis, deposits of cholesterol and other substances accumulate as plaque on the walls of arteries, which supply blood to the heart and rest of the body. These plaques can narrow the arteries, impeding or blocking blood flow. This can eventually lead to heart attack.Doctors commonly check for plaque and calcium deposits in the coronary arteries through a type of CT scan called coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan.Based on the scan results, doctors assign CAC scores, or Agatston scores, to estimate the person\u2019s risk of CHD.CAC scores are as follows:CAC scorePlaque burden0no plaque1\u201310minimal plaque11\u2013100mild atherosclerotic plaque101\u2013400moderate atherosclerotic plaqueover 400extensive atherosclerotic plaqueAlthough CAC scores are helpful to ascertain risk, they do not detect all types of plaque.

Iryna Imago/Getty ImagesResearchers recently examined several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to see whether any might effectively treat ulcerative colitis (UC). Their results suggest that cholesterol-lowering statins may reduce the need for anti-inflammatory drugs and surgical procedures to treat the condition. The researchers say that clinical trials to confirm their results must take place before doctors can prescribe statins for UC. Almost 1 million people in the United States have UC. Inflammation drives the condition, and scientists believe that it occurs when the immune system attacks the cells of the rectum or colon. Symptoms include blood in the stool, ongoing diarrhea that does not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and abdominal pain. Current treatments for the disease include anti-inflammatory drugs; however, a significant number of people do not respond to these drugs. A colectomy, the surgical removal of part or all of the colon, is the only curative option for the disease. A colectomy is usually a last resort treatment due to the adverse risks, such as internal bleeding, blood clots, and infection. Researchers are therefore interested in alternative ways to treat the condition. Developing drugs from scratch, however, is a lengthy and expensive process. Repurposing drugs that the FDA has already approved saves time and money when investigating new treatments. This is because they already have well-established safety profiles widely available clinical data.Scientists have already investigated repurposed drugs to treat diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer. In a recent study, researchers from Stanford University, CA, analyzed publicly available datasets of patient health information to identify FDA-approved drugs that may treat UC. They found that atorvastatin, available under the brand name Lipitor, had links to a significant reduction in colectomy rates, the need for anti-inflammatory medication, and hospitalization among those with UC. \u201cThese results are interesting, given the suggestion that a commonly used cardiovascular therapy could potentially be repurposed in the treatment of UC, \u201c Dr. Edward L. Barnes, MPH, assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. \u201cThe association of atorvastatin therapy with long-term outcomes, including the decreased rate of colectomy \u2014 when compared to patients prescribed a comparator drug \u2014 is interesting,\u201d he said.He also explained that \u201cprior studies of statin therapy have also suggested a benefit in the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including potentially decreased incidence rates, decreased steroid use, and lower rates of colorectal cancer.\u201d The new research appears in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association.
